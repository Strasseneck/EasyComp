Easy Comp

Easy comp is a jiu jitsu tournament organization web application, made for my CS50 Final Project. It's the first fullstack web app I ever made after only 12 weeks of programming with CS50.

# Stack 

Flask and SQLlite on the backend, vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS on the frontend. 

# Features

* In match scoreboard allows for adding scores and has a timer that makes use of CSS to emphasise time etc

* Create events page that dynamically calculates the divisions based on the user's weight and belt class inputs.
